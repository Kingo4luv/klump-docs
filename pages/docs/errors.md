For all of our transactions, Klump employs standard HTTP response codes. The error codes range from the 200s to the 500s. Success is indicated by HTTP response codes in the 2xx range. Depending on the action taken, we will typically send you a 200 or a 201. Those in the 4xx range indicate an error that was not detected based on the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted or access is denied from a resource etc.). Error codes in the 5xx range indicate a problem on our end (we are humans after all). See below:
